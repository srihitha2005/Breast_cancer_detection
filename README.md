# Breast_cancer_detection

This repository contains a  file, breast_cancer_model.py, which implements a breast cancer detection model using both Mp Neuron and perceptron algorithms and data preprocessing and collection. A .ipynb file is also added to show the implementation. additionally 2 files named MpNeuron.py and Perceptron.py are provided for usage.

2. Data Splitting
3. Binarizing the data
4. MP Neuron model
5. Perceptron model

## Usage
* To see the implementation of the model run the 'breast_cancer_model.ipynb' file
* To implement the model run the 'breast_cancer_model.py' file
* To use the Perceptron model import the 'perceptron.py' file
* To use the Mp Neuron model import the 'MpNeuron.py' file

## Dependencies
* Python
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib

## Note
* The model is for educational and research purposes only, and should not be used for medical   diagnosis without consulting a medical professional.
* The model is trained using the default parameters, but they can be adjusted as needed.

## Acknowledgments
* The Data is taken from scikit-learn datasets
